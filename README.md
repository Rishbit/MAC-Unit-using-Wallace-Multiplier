# MAC-Unit-using-Wallace-Multiplier

This is a project that employs a 16-bit Wallace Multiplier and a 34-bit Carry Look=Ahead Adder along with an accumulator to perform MAC operation on two inputs combinationally provided to the system.
A MAC system spends most of it's time to perform multiplication. When done using arithematic multiplication and partial product addition, this operation uses a lot of time, energy and physical area.
A Wallace Multiplier is used instead of a normal arithmetic multiplier to improve the speed of operation of the MAC unit. The multiplication operation of a MAC operation done with the help of a wallace multiplier saves the carries generated by addition of partial product bits and then passes it to the next stage. This combination takes place until all the partial products have been combined and only two such combinations remain at the end. Lastly, the two partial products are added using Carry Ripple Adder.
The adder block employs the Carry Look-Ahead Adder to perform the additon operation faster as compared to a Carry Ripple Adder.
The last block is the Accumulator used to store and circulate these stored values to perform appropriate MAC operation.
